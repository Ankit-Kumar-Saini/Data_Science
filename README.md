# Kaggle Data Science and Machine Learning Survey 2020 (Data Analysis)


## Introduction
- Every year from 2017, Kaggle conducts an industry-wide survey that presents a truly comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. The survey was live for 3.5 weeks in October and had 20,036 responses from over 55 countries and diverse demographics answering a wide range of questions ranging from frequently used ML algorithms, frameworks, cloud platforms, and products to the preferred programming languages and many others.


## Business Understanding
- As more and more companies are entering the digital world, the role of data science is becoming very important for the growth and development of these companies. Data Science as a field is also continuously evolving with new tools entering into the field every now and then. It becomes extremely important to uderstand the current tools and practices of the field for the aspiring data scientists in order to enter into the field. I am going to analyze the Kaggle 2020 Data Science and Machine Learning Survey to understand the current tools, frameworks and practices existing in the field by answering many questions through data and visualization.
